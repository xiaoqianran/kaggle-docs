# Competitions CLI Reference

Use `kaggle competitions` or alias `kaggle c` to discover competitions, inspect
and download competition files, submit predictions or code-kernel output, inspect
submissions and leaderboards, and browse competition discussion topics.

- Kaggle credentials for most commands. Some file listing/download flows may
  work logged out when the competition permits public access.

```bash
kaggle config set -n competition -v titanic
```

```

**Purpose:** Submit predictions or code-kernel output to a competition.
