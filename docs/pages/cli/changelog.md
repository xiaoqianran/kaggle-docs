### Next

* Keep the requested folder when downloading a single file with `kaggle datasets download -f` or `kaggle competitions download -f`, instead of writing it to the download root
* Add `kaggle competitions host-add <comp> -u <user>` to grant host access on a competition to a Kaggle user
* Suggest a next step on 403/404/429/5xx API errors, report unexpected errors as bugs instead of a traceback (with a new `--debug` flag), and list common examples in `kaggle --help`
* Add `kaggle benchmarks quota` to show Model Proxy (AI inference) spend quota, and bump `kagglesdk` to `>= 0.1.37`
* Add `kaggle competitions submission-download <id>` to download the submitted file for a single submission (requires `kagglesdk >= 0.1.36`)
* Add `deadline` (Competition Deadline) to the competition settings command and bump `kagglesdk` to `>= 0.1.36`
* Document that `NvidiaTeslaP100` is unusable for GPU compute with the default Kaggle image (PyTorch cu128 omits Pascal `sm_60` kernels)
* Add unified `kaggle search` command across competitions, datasets, notebooks, models, users, and discussions
* Add `--wait`/`--poll-interval` to `kaggle competitions submit` to wait for scoring, and add `kaggle competitions submission <ref>` to look up a single submission's status and score

* Fix a dataset download problem. Datasets that had a license were failing to download.
* Update the documentation to include code competition submit.

### 1.7.4

Version 1.7.3 was never released. There were errors in versioning on
test.pypi.org. For consistency, we decided to jump several version numbers.
This is the first release since 1.6.17.

The actual changes are described in 1.7.3.

### 1.7.3

There was an error in versioning. We went from 1.6.17 to 1.7.3.

* Added the ability to submit to a code competition. Some required arguments have been made optional.
* Added a `--timeout` option to `kaggle kernels push` to limit the run-time to the specified number of seconds.
* Removed Swagger. Projects that use `kaggle/api/kaggle_api.py` may be affected. That file is deprecated and will be
  removed. Most of its functions still work, but those that involve uploading files no longer work.
  The command-line tool uses a higher-level abstraction for uploading, and client code needs
  to be converted to use that.

### 1.7.3b2

* Added the ability to submit to a code competition. Some required arguments have been made optional.
* Added a `--timeout` option to `kaggle kernels push` to limit the run-time to the specified number of seconds.

### 1.7.3b1

* Fix escaped-quote issue in HTTP requests.

### 1.7.3b0

* Remove Swagger. No user-visible changes to the command-line tool. However, projects that
use `kaggle/api/kaggle_api.py` may be affected. That file is deprecated and will be removed.
Most of its functions still work, but those that involve uploading files no longer work.
The command-line tool uses a higher-level abstraction for uploading and client code needs 
to be converted to use that.

* [Issue #5](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/issues/5) -  Reformat code for consistency and to align with [Google's python coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).  Most of the changes are cosmetic, but most cases of `camelCasing` other than class names have been changed to `snake_case`.  This is a breaking change for anyone directly using the python code rather than simply using the command line.
